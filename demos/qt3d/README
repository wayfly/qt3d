This directory contains demos for the Qt3D C++ API.

Qt3D can be used to extend Qt Quick3D with custom 3D items.  Qt3D is also
a general 3D toolkit, featuring a scenegraph API, support for OpenGL VBO's
and other utilities for general 3D programming.

Research work on Qt3D also continues in the labs repository:

  http://qt.gitorious.org/qt-labs/qt3d

...and is from time to time ported into Qt Quick3D.

Check the labs version of Qt3D for additional cutting edge features such as
support for stereoscopic hardware.
