This directory contains examples for the Qt 3D C++ API.

Qt 3D can be used to extend Qt Quick with custom 3D items.  Qt 3D is also
a general 3D toolkit, featuring a scenegraph API, support for OpenGL VBO's
and other utilities for general 3D programming.

Running "qmake ; make" in either this directory or the example directories
will place any resulting binaries (and any required resources) into qt3d/bin in
the build tree, in line with the logic in pkg.pri.
Note that "make install" should not be run on the qt3d examples except for building packages.

Research work on Qt 3D also continues in the labs repository:

  http://qt.gitorious.org/qt-labs/qt3d

Check the labs version of Qt 3D for additional cutting edge features such as
support for stereoscopic hardware.
