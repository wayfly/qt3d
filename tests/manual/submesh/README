This test renders a lander model and submeshes to validate functionality.
A radar dish submesh is stripped off, and duplicated three times.
One instance rotates near the original position on the lander.  
If the submesh is not successfully removed from the model, there will be a second
stationary dish underneath/near this rotating dish.
A second model moves left and right, and should appear close to the right of lander.
The third dish is testing scaling.  Because of the way the scaling works, it may also appear to 
be moving left and right, and this is acceptable.
