This test renders a series of generated and file loaded meshes to validate functionality.

The first 5 meshes are dynamically generated.  They are: points, lines, sphere, cylinder, capsule.

The next 2 meshes are .obj files loaded at runtime.  They are: plane.obj, cube.obj.

The next mesh is a .bez teapot mesh.

The final mesh is a .3ds mesh of a lunar lander.

All meshes should be lit & shaded, and can be manually rotated by using ctrl+leftclick and dragging.

Zoom can be achieved by mouse wheel.

Click each object for an "Object clicked" debug message in the debugger.
