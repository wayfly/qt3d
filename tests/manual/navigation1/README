This tests navigation, specifically zooming and rotating the object using the default
navigation configuration for QML applications.

The first panel shows a 3D monkey head, and uses positional zooming: zooming in will
move the camera physically closer to the object until it is clipped by the near plane.

The second panel show a 3D monkey head, and uses field of view zooming: zooming is
based on adjusting the field of view: zooming in will not clip the object.
