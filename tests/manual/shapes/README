This is a basic manual test for the shapes classes in QML.
It needs to be extended greatly to deal with level-of-detail, and the
other properties which can be changed, such as radius and length,
also checking on the animations of these, and creation of larger
numbers of shapes.  This last item is to confirm that only one copy
of the geometry is created in this case.
