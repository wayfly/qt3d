    \qmltype Quad
    \instantiates Quad
    \brief The Quad item represents a simple quad in 3D space.
    \since 4.8
    \ingroup qt3d::qml3d::shapes
    \inherits Item3D

    The Quad element in QML provides a simple way to create a regular
    quad object, usually for testing material effects.  For example,
    the following QML code displays a quad of size 1.5, centered
    on the origin and covered in the Qt logo texture:

    \code
    Quad {
        scale: 1.5
        effect: Effect {
            color: "#aaca00"
            texture: "qtlogo.png"
        }
    }
    \endcode

    The Quad element is part of the \c{Qt3D.Shapes} namespace,
    so the following must appear at the top of any QML file that
    references it:

    \code
    import Qt3D.Shapes 2.0
    \endcode

    The quad can be moved from the origin by specifying the
    Item3D::position property:

    \code
    Quad {
        scale: 1.5
        position: Qt.vector3d(1, 0, 5)
        effect: Effect {
            color: "#aaca00"
            texture: "qtlogo.png"
        }
    }
    \endcode

    \sa Item3D
