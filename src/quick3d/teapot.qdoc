    \qmltype Teapot
    \instantiates Teapot
    \brief The Teapot item represents a stock teapot object.
    \since 4.8
    \ingroup qt3d::qml3d::shapes
    \inherits Item3D

    The Teapot element in QML provides a simple way to create a teapot
    object, usually for testing material effects and complex
    geometry.
    Teapot's center is the center of it's base.
    For example, the following QML code displays a teapot
    of size 1.5, covered in the Qt logo texture:

    \code
    Teapot {
        scale: 1.5
        effect: Effect {
            color: "#aaca00"
            texture: "qtlogo.png"
            decal: true
        }
    }
    \endcode

    \image teapot-qt-screenshot.png

    The Teapot element is part of the \c{Qt3D.Shapes} namespace,
    so the following must appear at the top of any QML file that
    references it:

    \code
    import Qt3D.Shapes 2.0
    \endcode

    The teapot can be moved from the origin by specifying the
    Item3D::position property:

    \code
    Teapot {
        scale: 1.5
        position: Qt.vector3d(1, 0, 5)
        effect: Effect {
            color: "#aaca00"
            texture: "qtlogo.png"
            decal: true
        }
    }
    \endcode

    \sa Item3D
