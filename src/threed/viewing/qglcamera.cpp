/*!
    \class QGLCamera
    \brief The QGLCamera class defines the projection to apply to simulate a camera's position, orientation, and optics.
    \since 4.8
    \ingroup qt3d
    \ingroup qt3d::viewing

    \section1 Modelview and projection transformations

    A QGLCamera instance is applied to the scene in two phases:
    modelview transformation and projection transformation.

    During the modelview transformation, the eye(), center(), and
    upVector() are used to generate a 4x4 transformation matrix that
    reflects the viewer's current position and orientation.

    During the projection transformation, the projectionType(),
    nearPlane(), farPlane(), fieldOfView(), and viewSize() are used
    to define a viewing volume as a 4x4 transformation matrix.

    The modelview transformation matrix is returned by modelViewMatrix().
    The projection transformation matrix is returned by projectionMatrix().

    \section1 Positioning and orienting the view

    The viewer position and orientation are defined by eye(), center(),
    and upVector().  The location of the viewer in world co-ordinates is
    given by eye(), the viewer is looking at the object of interest located
    at center(), and the upVector() specifies the direction that should
    be considered "up" with respect to the viewer.

    The vector from the eye() to the center() is called the "view vector",
    and the cross-product of the view vector and upVector() is called
    the "side vector".  The view vector specifies the direction the
    viewer is looking, and the side vector points off to the right of
    the viewer.

    It is recommended that the view vector and upVector() be at right angles
    to each other, but this is not required as long as the angle between
    them is close to 90 degrees.

    The most common use of view and up vectors that are not at right angles
    is to simulate a human eye at a specific height above the ground looking
    down at a lower object or up at a higher object.  In this case, the
    the view vector will not be true horizontal, but the upVector() indicating
    the human's upright stance will be true vertical.

    \section1 Zooming the camera image

    There are two ways to zoom the image seen through the camera: either
    the camera eye() position can be moved closer to the object of interest,
    or the field of view of the camera lens can be changed to make it appear
    as though the object is moving closer.

    Changing the eye() position changes the lighting calculation in the
    scene because the viewer is in a different position, changing the
    angle of light reflection on the object's surface.

    The setFieldOfView() function can be used to simulate the effect of a
    camera lens.  The smaller the fieldOfView(), the closer the object
    will appear.  The lighting calculation will be the same as for the
    unzoomed scene.

    If fieldOfView() is zero, then a standard perspective frustum of
    viewSize() is used to define the viewing volume.  The viewSize()
    can be adjusted with setViewSize() to zoom the view.  A smaller
    viewSize() will make the object appear closer.

    The fieldOfView() or viewSize() is applied as part of the
    projectionMatrix().

    \section1 Rotating the viewer or object of interest

    Rotating a viewer in 3D space is a very delicate process.  It is very
    easy to construct the rotation incorrectly and end up in a "gimbal lock"
    state where further rotations are impossible in certain directions.

    To help alleviate this problem, QGLCamera uses a quaternion-based
    approach to generate rotations.  A quaternion is a compact representation
    of a rotation in 3D space.  Rotations can be combined through quaternion
    multiplication.  More information on quaternions can be found in the
    documentation for QQuaternion.

    Before rotating the view, you should first decide the type
    of rotation you want to perform:

    \list
    \li Tilting or panning a fixed eye to reveal the scene in different
       directions and orientations.  This is equivalent to mounting a camera
       on a fixed tripod and then adjusting the direction of view and
       orientation with the tripod controls.
    \li Rotating a moving viewer about the object of interest.  This is
       equivalent to moving the viewer around the object at a fixed distance,
       but with the viewer always pointing at the object.
    \endlist

    In the QGLCamera class, the first type of rotation is performed with
    rotateEye() and the second with rotateCenter().  Each of these functions
    take a quaternion argument that defines the type of rotation to perform.

    The tilt(), pan(), and roll() functions return values that can help with
    constructing the rotation quaternions to pass to rotateEye() and
    rotateCenter().  Tilt and pan are also known as "pitch" and "yaw" in
    flight dynamics.

    Three axes of rotation are used to compute the quaternions.  The tilt()
    quaternion is computed with respect to the side vector, the pan()
    quaternion is computed with respect to the upVector(), and the roll()
    quaternion is computed with respect to the view vector.

    The following example tilts the direction the eye() is pointing
    by 5 degrees, and then pans by 45 degrees:

    \code
    camera.rotateEye(camera.tilt(5));
    camera.rotateEye(camera.pan(45));
    \endcode

    The next example performs the two rotations in a single fluid step
    (note that the rotation to be performed first is multiplied last):

    \code
    camera.rotateEye(camera.pan(45) * camera.tilt(5));
    \endcode

    These two examples will not produce the same visual result, even though
    it looks like they might.  In the first example, the upVector() is tilted
    before the pan() quaternion is computed.  In the second example, the pan()
    quaternion is computed using the original upVector().

    This difference in behavior is useful in different situations.  Some
    applications may wish to perform all rotations relative to the original
    viewer orientation, and other applications may wish to perform rotations
    relative to the current viewer orientation.  These application types
    correspond to the second and first examples above.

    \section1 Moving the viewer or object of interest

    The simplest way to move the viewer or object of interest is to call
    setEye() or setCenter() respectively and supply a new position in
    world co-ordinates.  However, this can lead to non-intuitive movements
    if the viewer orientation is not aligned with the world co-ordinate axes.

    For example, subtracting 3 from the eye() x co-ordinate will appear to
    move the eye left 3 units if the viewer orientation is aligned with the
    world co-ordinate axes.  But it will not appear to move the eye left 3
    units in any other orientation.

    The translation() function can be used to construct a translation
    vector that is aligned with the viewer's current orientation.
    Movement in the x direction will move along the side vector, movement in
    the y direction will move along upVector(), and movement in the z
    direction will move along the view vector.

    The translation() function is useful when implementing operations such
    as "step left", "jump up", and so on where the movement should be
    interpreted relative to the viewer's current orientation, not the
    world co-ordinate axes,

    In other words, the following two lines of code are not equivalent
    unless the view is oriented with the world co-ordinate axes:

    \code
    camera.translateEye(camera.translation(x, y, z));

    camera.translateEye(QVector3D(x, y, z));
    \endcode

    The following example translates the eye() position while
    keeping the object of interest at the original center():

    \code
    camera.translateEye(camera.translation(x, y, z));
    \endcode

    The following example translates the object of interest at
    center() while keeping the eye() position fixed:

    \code
    camera.translateCenter(camera.translation(x, y, z));
    \endcode

    The following example translates both the eye() and the center()
    by the same amount, which will maintain the original view vector.

    \code
    QVector3D vector = camera.translation(x, y, z);
    camera.translateEye(vector);
    camera.translateCenter(vector);
    \endcode

    It is important that the translation vector for center() be computed
    before eye() is translated if both eye() and center() must move by the
    same amount.  The following code translates center() in the viewer
    orientation after the eye() is translated:

    \code
    camera.translateEye(camera.translation(x, y, z));
    camera.translateCenter(camera.translation(x, y, z));
    \endcode

    Translating both eye() and center() by the same amount can be used
    to simulate sliding a viewer past a scene while always looking in the
    same direction (for example, filming a scene from a moving vehicle).
    An alternative is to fix the viewer and move the scene itself:
    the negation of the translation() vector can be applied to the
    scene's modelview transformation.

    \section1 Motion tracking

    Viewing of 3D scenes can be enhanced if there is some way to track
    the motion of the viewer or the orientation of the display device.

    Applications can use setMotionAdjustment() to alter the position
    of the camera to account for the viewer's motion.  This indicates
    the viewer's position relative to the center of the screen.
    The motionAdjustment() vector is used to determine by how much
    the camera position should be adjusted.  The distance of the viewer
    from the screen is ignored.

    On handheld devices that use accelerometers to determine the
    orientation of the device, the down vector due to gravity
    can be adjusted to serve as a motion tracking vector.

    The output of motion tracking hardware can be very noisy,
    with minor fluctuations due to viewer twitch movements or
    environmental factors.  The application is responsible for
    cleaning up the signal and removing these fluctuations before
    setMotionAdjustment() is called.

    \section1 Stereo projections

    QGLCamera can adjust the camera position for rendering separate left
    and right eye images by setting eyeSeparation() to a non-zero value.
    The eyeSeparation() is in world co-ordinates.

    Objects that are placed at center() will coincide in the left and
    right eye images, establishing the logical center of the stereo
    effect.  Objects that are closer to the eye() will be rendered
    to appear closer in the stereo effect, and objects that are further
    away from eye() than center() will be rendered to appear further away.

    Perspective and Orthographic projections incorporate the
    eyeSeparation() into the modelViewMatrix() by altering the
    eye() position.

    \brief The Camera item defines the viewing position and projection for a 3D scene.
    \since 4.8
    \ingroup qt3d::qml3d

    Camera instances are defined on a \l Viewport item using the
    Viewport::camera property:

    import Qt3D 2.0

    Viewport {
        width: 640; height: 480

            effect: Effect {}
        }
    }
    \endcode

    \section1 Positioning and orienting the view

    The viewer position and orientation are defined by \l eye, \l center,
    and \l upVector.  The location of the viewer in world co-ordinates is
    given by \l eye, the viewer is looking at the object of interest located
    at \l center, and the \l upVector specifies the direction that should
    be considered "up" with respect to the viewer.

    The vector from the \l eye to the \l center is called the "view vector",
    and the cross-product of the view vector and \l upVector is called
    the "side vector".  The view vector specifies the direction the
    viewer is looking, and the side vector points off to the right of
    the viewer.

    It is recommended that the view vector and \l upVector be at right angles
    to each other, but this is not required as long as the angle between
    them is close to 90 degrees.

    The most common use of view and up vectors that are not at right angles
    is to simulate a human eye at a specific height above the ground looking
    down at a lower object or up at a higher object.  In this case, the
    the view vector will not be true horizontal, but the \l upVector
    indicating the human's upright stance will be true vertical.

    \section1 Zooming the camera image

    There are two ways to zoom the image seen through the camera: either
    the camera \l eye position can be moved closer to the object of interest,
    or the field of view of the camera lens can be changed to make it appear
    as though the object is moving closer.

    Changing the \l eye position changes the lighting calculation in the
    scene because the viewer is in a different position, changing the
    angle of light reflection on the object's surface.

    The \l fieldOfView property function can be used to simulate the effect
    of a camera lens.  The smaller the \l fieldOfView, the closer the object
    will appear.  The lighting calculation will be the same as for the
    unzoomed scene.

    If \l fieldOfView is zero, then a standard perspective frustum of
    is used to define the viewing volume based on the width and height
    of the \l Viewport.

    \section1 Stereo projections

    Camera can adjust the camera position for rendering separate left
    and right eye images by setting the \l eyeSeparation property
    to a non-zero value.  The \l eyeSeparation is in world co-ordinates.

    Objects that are placed at \l center will coincide in the left and
    right eye images, establishing the logical center of the stereo
    effect.  Objects that are closer to the \l eye will be rendered
    to appear closer in the stereo effect, and objects that are further
    away from \l eye than \l center will be rendered to appear further away.

    adjustment vector and the screen center is used to adjust the

    meters, centimeters, or the force due to gravity in various
    directions from an accelerometer.  The angle defined

    magnitude.

    The output of motion tracking hardware can be very noisy,
    with minor fluctuations due to viewer twitch movements or

    cleaning up the signal and removing these fluctuations before
